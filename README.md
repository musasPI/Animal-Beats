# AnimalSound-s
AnimalSound's was made with MIT App Inventor. The app is currently at version 1.7.1, and it consists of two images: one of a cat and one of a Beagle dog. When you click on one of the images, the corresponding animal sound will play. If both images are clicked simultaneously, both sounds will play at the same time.â€‹
