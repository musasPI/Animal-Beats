# Animal Beats
Animal Beats (Old AnimalSounds) was made with MIT App Inventor. The app is currently at version 1.7 (exactly 1.7.1.2), and it consists of two images: the top image is of a Cat and the bottom image is of a Beagle dog. When you click on one of the images, the corresponding animal sound will play. If both images are clicked simultaneously, both sounds will play at the same time.​

For now, I am not focusing in Animal Beats but i'll finishe in other day!

Sorry for my english, i'm begginer but i think that my english is functional.
